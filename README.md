# Kinky Poker

Poker Link is in the Room description! (start with a stack of 1000)

## The rules are:
1. The person who wins a round gets to punish one of the loosers of the round
2. If you fold you can't be punished
3. Punishments last until you win or someone else gives you another one that conflicts with it
4. If you go bankrupt you will get a permanent punishment (for the duration of your stay)
5. The permanent punishment(s) is seperate from the normal loose choice, that the winner gets
6. Make your punishments severity dependent on how much you win by (This has to be judged by yourself since the amount you win by depends heavily on how many people are in a round)
7. Personal Limits MUST be respected, personal likes and bio should be respected.
8. On tie / split pot, winner is the one who wins the most chips
9. If you don't play, you are not allowed to interact with any participant
10. If you don't play, refrain from playin with other people watching, and bring your plays to another room.
(if you are still unsure, you can watch for a few rounds, but behave!)

-- Any Violation of these rules results in instant punishment --
