# Kinky Poker

Poker Link is in the Room description! (start with a stack of 1000)

## Basic Rules
1. The person who wins a round gets to punish one of the losers of the round
2. If you fold you can't be punished
3. Punishments last until you win or someone else gives you another one that conflicts with it
4. If you go bankrupt you will get a permanent punishment as cost for the the rebuy

#### Obvious rules, but written down nonetheless
- Make your punishments severity dependent on how big you win by (This has to be judged by yourself, but rarity and earnings are a good guideline)
-  Personal Limits MUST be respected, personal likes and bio should be respected.

#### Permanent Punishments
- The permanent punishment does not affect the normal winner > looser choice and is an independent punishment.
- You can use a normal punishment to change a permanent one to a different permanent (that is similar) one, if both agree
- If a person manages to bankrupt another, this person may choose to get rid of a permanent one on themselves, instead enforcing a new one on the loser.

#### Special Cases
- on split pot, the true winner is the one who wins the most chips. This one may select a punishment.
- On split pot, if there are other winners (that recieve less chips), those gain immunity for this round.
- On a tie, all winners have to colab and choose a punishment together.



## Non-Participants / Watching:
- If you don't play, you are not allowed to interact with any participant
- If you don't play, refrain from playin with other observers
- This is not a place to go AFK, watching actively is fine, yet AFKlers will be removed
- If you don't play, don't disturb the participants, neither by **excessive** emotes or chatting with others.


(if you are still unsure, you can watch for a few rounds, but behave!)



### -- Any Violation of these rules results in instant punishment and/or removal from the room --
